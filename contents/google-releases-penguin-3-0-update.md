Some people noticed major changes in Google search results beginning late Friday night US time.

Google has [confirmed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi21yMBO9gI#t=2797) that the Penguin 3.0 roll out is complete as of Monday morning, October 20th.

Penguin 3.0 is already the sixth release of Penguin. The latest Penguin release is one of the most anticipated search engine algorithm updates in Google’s history. Many publishers have been long waiting for the refresh that has arrived just over the year. Let me remind you that the latest Penguin update, Penguin 2.1 was released on October 4, 2013 , impacting around 1 % of queries.

Penguin will hit spammy links, so that they no longer pass along the credit or act as “votes” as they once might have.

Penguin 3.0 update: “Spammy links, no pasaran to SERP.”

**Update 1:** [According to Google’s John Mueller](https://plus.google.com/+BarrySchwartz/posts/WG6PauMYzJ2) it looks like release may still be happening.  
**Update 2**: [Google’s Pierre Far](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+PierreFar/posts/NURBpsNpef4) says Penguin roll out is far from complete: “It’s a slow worldwide rollout, so you may notice it settling down over the next few weeks.”
