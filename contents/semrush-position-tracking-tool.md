# SEMrush Open Beta Testing for Position Tracking Tool

Published on December 25, 2012

Last Week [SEMrush](http://www.semrush.com/sem.html?ref=423553501 "SEMrush") announced open beta testing for their new **Position Tracking** Tool! In order to try it out, you don’t need to do anything special. If you already have an active account, simply log in! If you don’t have an account, all you need to do is register.

I have already tried the tool. This is really great. Recently a number of leading SEO and web analytics tool providers have eliminated their SERP tracking tools, and at the same time SEMrush is starting their BETA version which is quite great!

I have created 2 campaigns (out of 5) and enjoy SERP results updated daily.

You can also add your competitors, see their results and compare the positions, You can choose the search engines, location, visualize the rankings history and a lot more.

If you are interested in this new feature integrated in SEMrush, follow the link to register an account and enjoy: **[SEMrush](http://www.semrush.com/sem.html?ref=423553501 "SEMrush")**
