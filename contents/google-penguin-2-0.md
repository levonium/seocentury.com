There has been much talk lately about some kind of major Google update – Google Penguin 2.0 and Matt Cutts has confirmed in his latest video that we can expect the next Penguin update in the next few weeks.

Google’s Penguin update launched in April 2012, and there were 2 refreshes last year – in May and October. It was released to better catch sites spamming search results, in particular those doing so by buying links or obtaining them through link networks designed primarily to boost Google rankings.
