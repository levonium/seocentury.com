# Likely There Will Be No Toolbar PageRank Update This Year

Published on October 7, 2013

The last Google Toolbar PageRank Update was in February 2013 and it seems there will be no update this year.

Since then there has been no comment about it from Google, only yesterday Matt Cutts, Google webspam head, answered to a tweet by Niels Bosch:

Also there’s a video on the same topic, watch it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=M7glS_ehpGY).

Those who are still waiting for the PageRank update, should probably forget about it, at least until 2014.
