Really, you are not alone and you do not need to take any actions.

> Some Webmaster Tools users have reported missing data in the “**Links to your site**” section. We are aware of this issue and are looking into it; **you do not need to take any action**. We hope to have the normal data shown again in the near future. The data shown there is informational and does not affect your site’s crawling, indexing or ranking.
