# LinkedIn Crosses 1 Million Publishers On Its Blogging Platform

Published on July 15, 2015

Good news! LinkedIn crosses 1 million unique publishers on LinkedIn’s blogging platform.

“We just reached an incredible milestone for the LinkedIn publishing platform: 1 million professionals have now written a post on [LinkedIn](https://blog.linkedin.com/2015/07/09/1-million-linkedin-publishers/).”

I should admit that LinkedIn has always been one of my favorite websites. Since I joined it in January 2011, I have been constantly learning new insights from professionals all around the world.

When the publishing option first became available, I could not hide my excitement. In the beginning, I was following the Influencers. Later, when all English speaking members were able to publish on LinkedIn blogging platform, I didn’t hesitate to use this great opportunity straight away.

LinkedIn became for me a website for content curation, blogs, CV and more. It gave me an opportunity to follow and connect with the most influential people in my industry, learn from them and grow as a professional.

Today I have published my 20th post on LinkedIn and I am really excited about continuing publishing there. I remember I was really afraid to publish my first post and expose it to a large and professional LinkedIn community. My first post wasn’t definitely successful but I got some engagement and I moved on.

Later, a few of my posts were featured on LinkedIn pulse and one of them dedicated to [Black hat social media](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140903133737-102575515-how-black-hat-social-media-affects-seo?trk=mp-reader-card) crossed 3,000 views.

What is important, I understood that we should not be afraid to take the first steps. We should not be perfect to start things, we just need to start and make things better.

And if you are not publishing on LinkedIn, you should be. Why?

**“****1 million unique publishers** publish more than **130,000 posts a week** on LinkedIn. About **45% of readers** are in the upper ranks of their industries: managers, VPs, CEOs, etc. The top content-demanding industries are tech, financial services and higher education. The average post now reaches professionals in 21 industries and 9 countries.”

LinkedIn publishing is open to all English speaking members, and is said to soon be available in every language.

Good luck!
