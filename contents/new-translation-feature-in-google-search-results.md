# New Translation Feature in Google Search Results

Published on July 17, 2014

Google adds a new translation feature to its search results making it very easy to translate texts, edit them, change the languages and even hear the translated texts directly from the search results page.

Just start typing “translate” on Google search box and it will let you quickly enter the text you need to translate and the box below.

I think this is an awesome addition and can help save time a lot. Here’s an example:

You can translate the terms you need just typing it in the search box: for example: “**translate hello friend to spanish**”
