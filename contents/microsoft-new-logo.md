# Microsoft&#8217;s New Logo

Published on August 24, 2012

Microsoft has changed their logo.
Everyone would remember the old one: black, bold, Sans-Serif font:

The new version of Microsoft logo uses a symbol for the first time of the company’s history. It is a square made of four smaller squares of different colors. It reminds Microsoft’s Windows logo, however, it is straight and doesn’t look like waving flag.

New logo is softer-looking and more colorful. It uses Segoe font which looks softer and lighter than the previous font and is more grey than black. As in the previous version of the logotype, in the new one as well, the last two letters -f and t – are linked each other.

Microsoft’s new logo is already used in the site Microsoft.com.. Compare:

Well, I like the new logo, what’s your opinion?
