**Google Analytics design and structural changes**

There were some interesting changes and now your analysis software is easier to navigate and to find some ‘hidden’ features you might have missed before.

Here are some of the changes I would like to mention:

- Top Navigation Bar
- Sidebar
- Dashboard Customizations
- 2 New Widget Options: GEOMAP and BAR

Hope this changes will help getting more data and more visualizations.

Happy analyzing!!
