**1) Maps 2) YouTube 3) Web search**

Let’s look at that list today, following [the news](https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/06/youtube-app-removed-from-ios-6-because-apples-licensing-agreement-is-over/) that YouTube has been given the boot in the latest beta build of iOS 6:
1\) Maps 2) YouTube **3) Web search**

**[Two down. One to go.](https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/06/two-down-one-to-go/)**

*However, since it’s not integrated in the iOS, you’ll have to download YouTube app from the app store and, it will become**, I think,* *one of the top apps. So, is it good or bad? What you think?*
