# Pinterest: Testing A New Look

Published on January 29, 2013

Pinterest we’ll be testing an update with a small group of people soon.

They’re going to make the navigation more intuitive, so it’s faster to get to where you want to go.

Pins are going to be bigger and they’ve added more information related to pins, so it’s easier to find things you’re interested in.

In addition to the visible changes, they also made some improvements ‘behind the scenes’ that hopefully will make things faster.

Pinterest will preview the update with a small group of people over the coming weeks. If you’re interested in being one of the first to see the new look, [Send them a notification](https://docs.google.com/a/pinterest.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGJNTmxwNEEzSzZYeFBvcnU0WXQ3M1E6MQ).
