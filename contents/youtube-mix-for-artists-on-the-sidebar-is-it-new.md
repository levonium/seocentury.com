# YouTube Mix for Artists/Bands on the Sidebar. Is it new?

Published on May 26, 2014

Have you noticed this before on YouTube?

When you search for an artist/group/band along with usual results, on the right sidebar YouTube returns ‘**YouTube Mix**‘ for the artist with a larger cover photos. Below the ‘YouTube Mix’ there are ‘**Top songs**‘ and ‘**Albums**‘ tabs displaying their songs and albums.

Below there’s also ‘**Related artists**‘ box showing 3 artists with album covers.![YouTube Mix on Sidebar](https://www.seocentury.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/youtube-mix-on-sidebar.jpg)

Maybe it is new to me only, maybe there are other changes as well. Let me know, if you know one.
