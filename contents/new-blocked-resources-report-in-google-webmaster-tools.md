# New Blocked Resources Report in Google Webmaster Tools

Published on March 12, 2015

Google Webmaster Tools now has a new cool report showing the blocked content used across the whole website. Here is the new report URL: <https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/roboted>

The report includes the files you might have unintentionally blocked from crawling, for example some images, css or javascript files, or there may be resources loaded externally.

Here’s a screenshot of the report for one of our client’s websites, which shows that there are quite a lot of blocked content:

The blocked resources report shows the hosts and the number of blocked resources on them. When you select a host, the report lists the blocked resources and the number of pages affected.

From the list you can select a resource and check out the affected pages. This can you help find out the issues you might have missed so far. Check it out!
