# Smart Tips to Manage Your LinkedIn Activities

Published on March 10, 2015

I’ve been always thinking that LinkedIn is one of the most interesting and useful networks where people share their professional experience, background, skills and improve their knowledge. However, more and more I notice posts that, in my opinion, are irrelevant to LinkedIn and activities that are managed poorly.

**Everything you do on LinkedIn should be done carefully.**

Be aware of what you post. It’s crucially important to know what you post and consider that your posts speak a lot about you. Posts like quotes/articles on health are not for you unless you are someone who works, for example, as a doctor or else in the medical industry. Let’s say you’re an entrepreneur. Would you post about health, how to get in a good physical shape, etc. even if you like the topic a lot? I guess you would prefer posting something about leadership, tips for entrepreneurs. And, definitely, this is what should be done.

The below image is an example of some of the post types that I find completely inappropriate for LinkedIn.

**Getting the right people on board:** It’s very simple to click the button and accept someone into your connections but it’s something you should never do unless you at least briefly are aware of the person’s professional profile. If you know the person personally, good. If no, take 2 minutes and scan his LinkedIn profile. Make sure your connections are somehow related to you, your business or people who can be interested in what you do. This will not only increase the level of engagement of your posts, but also this way your news feed will become more relevant to your interests.

Control what you like. Whatever you like on LinkedIn appears in the news feed and shapes an image about you. If you’re someone in the information technology industry who likes the posts about politics, you better stop it. Is LinkedIn the right place where you should hit like and follow this type of posts?

**Carefully choose the groups to join.** I am sure you have been invited to many groups on LinkedIn that don’t really call your attention. The answer is simple you should not be there. Choose the groups that are of your interest and are relevant to your professional profile.

**Determine the companies to follow.** Follow the companies you really like.In other words, choose the companies that share things you would like to see, the companies that are relevant to your interests.

Following all the above stages, you’ll see that LinkedIn is one of the best places to promote yourself, your brand or just to grow your professional network.
