Published on February 12, 2015

Every business owner expects customer engagement, however, few really know what *value* means for the customers.

**What is a customer engagement?**

CRM Expert Paul Greenberg defines customer engagement as “the ongoing interactions between company and customer, offered by the company, chosen by the customer.”

Isn’t it so? Definitely it is.

To engage your customers there’s no need of having one-to-one customer relationships which will take a lot of time and efforts. The main idea is to offer a product/service that makes a value for the customers and is chosen by them.

Do not just offer something, think about ***what your customers need, what solutions to their problems you offer and what are their expectations***.

- ****What do you offer?****

Ask yourself a question if your company offer is interesting to a customer? Is it chosen by a customer?

It’s obvious that for businesses it becomes harder to stand out from the crowd unless they:

- provide something unique
- find a solution to a problem
- whatever they provide, they do it in the best way.

Give your customers what they expect.

- ****Are your customers happy. Have you heard from your customers?****

Do they have a personalized experience with you?

No customer would hang on for a long time until he gets an answer. Customers are looking for fast and quality services and these both aspects are very important for their emotional satisfaction. Show an individual approach to each of your customers.

How about asking your customers about sharing their experiences with you?

You would never know if they are happy with your services unless you hear from them. One of the ideas is to put a survey on the website that will allow them to rate your services.

While sending out emails, as part of your email marketing campaign, ask them to fill out the form/take a survey/answer questions.

Customer engagement is a constant relationship that needs development and improvement.  
Customer engagement is one of your most important goals and your biggest responsibility.
