Published on July 1, 2015

Pinterest rolls out buyable pins. Now its users can buy pins right from their iPhone and iPad devices. The brand has partnered with thousands of brands including Macy’s, Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom to offer Buyable Pins.

The announcement was made earlier this month on [Pinterest blog](https://blog.pinterest.com/en/buyable-pins-rolling-out-today).

“Earlier this month, we [announced buyable Pins](https://blog.pinterest.com/buyable-pins)—the simple, secure way to buy your favorite products on Pinterest. Today, we’re excited to start rolling them out to U.S. Pinners on iPhone and iPad.

Here’s a quick look at how everything works.

**Blue means you can buy**

You’ll start seeing buyable Pins all over Pinterest—in your home feed, on boards you love, and in search results. When you spot a Pin with a blue price, that means you can buy it.”

Buyable Pins offer a number of products from Nordstrom, top retailers like national craft chain Michael’s and more. Many users will find that the items they’ve pinned before are available for purchase. They will be notified of price changes and sales on items they’ve already pinned.

If you are not ready to buy the item, you can pin your favorite option and come back to it later.
