> <span>The search giant is known for its playful, unconventional workspaces—perhaps intended to offset its fairly Vader-esque public image, and certainly, to sweeten the deal for young, in-demand engineers who may be juggling other offers. In </span>[Pittsburgh](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1663160/google-unveils-not-evil-office-in-pittsburgh)<span>, Googlers enjoy an industrial theme and slides.

Now, a third office—a “Super HQ”—has opened on the eighth floor of </span>[Central Saint Giles](http://www.archdaily.com/104147/central-st-giles-court-renzo-piano-fletcher-priest-architects/)<span>, the Renzo Piano-designed tower in Covent Garden.</span>
