Happy Halloween, all!

Have you you checked out today’s Google Doodle? I personally liked all the logos, from ghost-chasing dogs to a witch stirring her brew.

Halloween is also known as All Hallows Eve and All Saints Eve. It has been around throughout the ages, with its beginnings often credited to the Celts who celebrated the day to mark the end of their Harvest season.

Today, Halloween is one of the most favorite days for many people around the world, especially for children, who would dress up in a Superhero or Frozen character on this special day.
