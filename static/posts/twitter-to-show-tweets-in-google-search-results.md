# Twitter to Show Tweets in Google Search Results

Published on February 6, 2015

Twitter has reached a deal with Google to make its 140-character tweets more searchable online. Before this deal, Google had to crawl Twitter’s site for the information, which now is going to be visible automatically.

In the first half of this year, [tweets will start to be visible in Google’s search results](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-05/twitter-said-to-reach-deal-for-tweets-in-google-search-results?hootPostID=9b76d1c20c5f48cb890da42c6a0d7368) as soon as they’re posted, thanks to a deal giving Google access to Twitter’s firehose. Twitter firehose is the full stream of tweets generated by the microblogging service’s 284 million users.

This deal is mutually beneficial. For Twitter it “means more opportunities to convert, and possibly monetize, logged-out users. It will also increase the frequency that people with Twitter accounts check the site”, said Doug Anmuth, an analyst at JPMorgan, in a note to investors. While “for Google, we believe search results will be enhanced by access to real-time tweets and a much broader amount of content.”
