Pretty nice figures… 11.3% change in Mobile MUAs, it seems like ‘[Facebook is going to become a mobile company](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CGIQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zdnet.com%2Fblog%2Ffacebook%2Ffacebook-were-going-to-become-a-mobile-company%2F4157&ei=06AbUJDXGouk4AS5lIDgDA&usg=AFQjCNGO_jqPe8tFC58kbl_gioi0NWnwSQ)‘ however, analysts say ‘[Facebook will disappear by 2020.](http://mashable.com/2012/06/04/analyst-facebook-disappear/)‘ Well, time will show..

Now, out of that 955 million user accounts a total of **8.7%** or **83 million** accounts on the network are ‘fake’. And, of that 8.7% there are duplicate accounts (4.8% – 46 million), user-misclassified accounts (2.4% – 23 million) and undesirable (spam) accounts (1.5% -14 million).

**83 million fake accounts**, by the way, Germany’s population is almost the same…

In March 2012, Facebook claimed about **5% to 6%** of its accounts (or **40.3 million to 50.7 million**) were fake. So, more than **30 million** ‘new fake’ accounts are out there. However, the company also says it bans at least [20,000 accounts](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/facebook/facebook-bans-20000-accounts-daily/965) daily and estimates about [600,000 accounts](http://mashable.com/2011/10/28/facebook-600000-accounts-compromised/) per day are compromised. So, according to the latest figures, Facebook’s 955 million active users would reach 872 million.

Yes, time will show…
