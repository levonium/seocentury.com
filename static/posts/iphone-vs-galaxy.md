# iPhone 5 &amp; Samsung Galaxy SIII

Published on September 16, 2012

Recently, Apple revealed the latest — and in its words the greatest — version of the iPhone: iPhone 5. The competition is – and has always been – huge between Samsung Galaxy and iPhone. And though Samsung lost the patent battle against Apple, but it doesn’t mean they quieted down.

*In a new ad shown to [Mashable](http://mashable.com/2012/09/15/samsung-ad-iphone-5/ "Mashable") that will start running in various national and regional papers on Sunday, Samsung – the Korean electronics giant – has stacked the specs of its Galaxy S III smartphone against the newly-announced iPhone 5.*

The tagline of the ad: **It doesn’t take a genius.**

Obviously, Galaxy S III has a much longer list of features than the iPhone 5, and its main advantages over the iPhone are **HD resolution**, **RAM** and **Talk Time**, + **NFC** (near-field communications) technology, which is not included in the iPhone 5.

Also, pay attention to the last feature of the iPhone 5 – **a totally different plug** – it’s the key feature and the main advantage of the new iPhone 5.
