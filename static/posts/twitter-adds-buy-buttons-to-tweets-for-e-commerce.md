Twitter has rolled out a ‘Buy’ button for a small number of U.S. citizens, and plans to include all U.S. users over time. Twitter’s head of commerce, Nathan Hubbard, who joined the company about a year ago and his small team worked on this product.

<div>Here how the [buy button](https://blog.twitter.com/2014/testing-a-way-for-you-to-make-purchases-on-twitter) works.</div>“After tapping the ‘Buy’ button, you will get additional product details and be prompted to enter your shipping and payment information. Once that’s entered and confirmed, your order information is sent to the merchant for delivery.”

Do you think this will work out on Twitter? Hubbard thinks it will.

**Twitter algorithm shows users the right offers.**  
Twitter’s interest graph, geo data, and contextual data should help in product e-commerce.

**Twitter is where influential people are concentrated**. “Influencers, as they weigh in, can accelerate users down the purchase funnel,” says Hubbard. It’s really hard to disagree with this. It’s enough for influential people to say “hi” and it turns into a trending #.

**Twitter is a real-time network**. If you want something on Twitter right now, you can always get.

I personally think Twitter is a successful social media channel and its taking a stab at e-commerce won’t fail. Unlike Facebook “Send a Gift” that was recently shut down, Twitter’s “Buy Now” idea seems to have a future.

Let me remind you that Twitter has recently made [changes to what users see in their Twitter timelines](https://www.seocentury.com/blog/twitter-timelines-changes/). This may also sounds interesting to you.
