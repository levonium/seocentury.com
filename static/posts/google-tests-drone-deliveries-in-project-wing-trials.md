# Google tests drone deliveries in Project Wing trials

Published on August 29, 2014

Google has built and tested autonomous aerial vehicles, which according to the company could be used for goods deliveries such as humanitarian aid to people in need and consumer deliveries.

The Project Wing has been running for almost two years but was a secret until now.

Google aims to help people and deliver stuff that is needed in the areas where vehicles cannot be reached. The self-flying vehicles can be used after earthquakes, floods, or extreme weather events and deliver medicines to people. The drones can transport the equipment faster than an ambulance could.

Dave Voss, incoming leader of Project Wing,[ said](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28964260):  
“When you have a tool like this you can really allow the operators of those emergency services to add an entirely new dimension to the set of tools and solutions that they can think of.”

Also, Astro Teller, Captain of Moonshots – Google X’s name for big-thinking projects explained: “Even just a few of these, being able to shuttle nearly continuously could service a very large number of people in an emergency situation.”

In addition to the above, Google said it could use self-flying drones for delivering shopping items to consumers at home, just like at Amazon and Domino’s Pizza do.
