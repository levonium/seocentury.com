# Why You Need Visual Content Marketing

Published on June 18, 2015

Visual content has never been as important as today. It has become a vital part of content marketing strategy. For many Internet users visuals determine whether web content is worth their time. I personally think this definitely makes sense.

Today’s Internet is not what it was in the beginning or even a few years ago. Web is full of information while time is never enough for it. People basically scan the information through visuals and whatever helps them scan it quickly is more than welcome.

It’s definitely a great idea to use infographics, images, videos and other visuals right on the page instead of hyperlinking them in a content.

Why exactly visual content marketing should be an integral part of content marketing strategy? See the below points:

- Almost 50% of our brain is involved in visual processing
- 70% of all our sensory receptors are in our eyes
- We can get the sense of a visual scene in less than 1/10 of a second

Text-based content without visuals is not what users are looking for today even on social networks. Text-based posts on social networks get less clicks and impact than the ones that contain beautiful images, for example.

We undoubtedly process visual content faster than the text-based one, however, a simple caption is many times required to tell a visual story more effectively. Visual content should be relevant, informative and organized.

Relevant, organized and informative visual content helps web users quickly get the principal idea of it. Visual content marketing is powerful and if you do it properly, you’ll definitely notice that your content marketing campaign works better.

No matter if you’re going to create a page or website, or publish another post in your blog, scan through the content and ask yourself a question whether you were able to get the idea by scanning it visually.
