Published on November 18, 2014

Google’s adding a “**mobile-friendly**” label to the mobile search results starting from today. As [they say](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com.es/2014/11/helping-users-find-mobile-friendly-pages.html), the change will be rolling out globally over the next few weeks.

To be eligible for the “mobile-friendly” label, a web page needs to meet the following criteria:

\[checklist icon=”fa-check” iconcolor=”#000000″ circle=”no” circlecolor=”” size=”medium” class=”” id=””\]

- Avoid using software not supported by mobile devices (Flash)
- Text should be readable without zooming
- Users do not have to scroll horizontally or zoom (screen sizing)
- Users should be able to click on the desired link on a page easily (links should be placed far from each other)

So, do you think your website is mobile-friendly? Think no more!
