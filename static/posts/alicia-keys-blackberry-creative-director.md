**BlackBerry** certainly surprised us today at its **BlackBerry 10** launch event.

Not only did it announce its plans to drop **RIM (Research in Motion)** from its name – it’s now just BlackBerry – but towards the end of the presentation CEO **Thorsten Heins** brought **Alicia Keys** on stage. And not just as a performer or to endorse the new products. He announced the singer and songwriter as the new BlackBerry global creative director.

Keys said she will be involved in a range of activities and described the role as being “hands on.”
