# Google&#8217;s Panda 4.0 Forces PR Newswire to Take Action Against Spammers

Published on June 30, 2014

[Google Panda 4.0](http://www.360opps.com/seo/google-rolls-out-panda-4-0/) had pretty negative effects on press release sites, including the large press release distribution company – PR Newswire. Panda aims to take down on low quality content and prevent low quality websites from ranking high in the search engine results pages (SERP).[![pr-newswire](https://www.seocentury.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/f-pr-newswire.jpg)](https://www.seocentury.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/f-pr-newswire.jpg)

The PR Newswire aims to recover from algorithmic penalty by taking action on spammers with the following [new press release guidelines](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pr-newswire-takes-action-against-spammers-with-new-press-release-guidelines--deletion-of-low-quality-content-263986161.html):

- Inclusion of insightful analysis and original content (e.g. research, reporting or other interesting and useful information);
- Use of varied release formats, guarding against repeated use of templated copy (except boilerplate);
- Assessing release length, guarding against issue of very short, unsubstantial messages that are mere vehicles for links;
- Overuse of keywords and/or links within the message.

The company has announced that new content will be evaluated under new guidelines and this will help reduce distribution of low quality content over PR Newswire network. PR newswire also took action on identifying and removing the low quality content.

The PR Newswire CEO – Ninan Chacko – said: “PR Newswire is committed to continuously improving the quality of the content distributed via our network, website, and other digital channels in order to better serve the millions of journalists, bloggers and members of the public who read press releases each month. By reviewing each piece of content to ensure message quality, and deleting releases we find to be of low quality, we will increase the value of our content and website for our audiences, and limit the exploitation of content distribution for questionable SEO tactics.”

This sounds good and I wish PR Newswire best of luck. <span class="share-body"><span class="commentary" id="control_gen_10">My honest recommendation to all those who push content on the web is to always review it. Don’t push a bunch of low-quality content as sooner or later your website will be hit by manual or algorithmic penalty. And it will take time plenty of time to get rid of it</span></span>.

Stay tuned!
