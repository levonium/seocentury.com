When writing content, it is critical to put reader’s interest first. Prior to covering any topic, make sure you’re aware of what users are looking for in a particular industry to provide content that makes value. You may try Google AdWords Keyword Planner or any other tool for keyword research to determine phrases that people search and get some search data about them. Meantime, remember that great content is not about keywords, it’s about providing content that makes value and fits keywords smoothly in it.

What kind of content people do love to read?

1. **Content that helps solve a problem/find a solution**.

Internet users appreciate content that helps them solve their problem, I call it a *‘how to’ content.* Here’s an example: ‘How to create and verify a local business on Google?’

They’d love to know the steps on how to create an account and see the screenshots that will guide them step by step to get their task done. Helpful content is a great piece of read. Make sure your content finds the best solution to a problem for a user.

2. **Content that shares a valuable experience**.

If you have an interesting story to tell, people would love to read about it. As an example, you may share with your industry how you started a small brand and reached success, what exactly helped you in doing that, how you increased sales in 30 days and more. Internet users might love it more than just reading tips about how to increase sales. Sometimes we prefer seeing how a particular thing worked out for someone, isn’t it so?

3. **Content that is informative**.

Content that provides research/data or is simply informative, clear and written in smart manner will always stand out from the crowd. Example: top 10 social brands, Google algorithm change history and more**.** Your content should give some knowledge, something users will learn and will love to use in their experience. Recently I wrote a post about [7 simple yet critical content marketing tactics](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20140917111612-102575515-7-simple-yet-critical-content-creation-tips?trk=prof-post). I probably have not covered something completely new but whatever I wrote was emphasized well, which is sometimes very important and yes, my readers loved it.  
Hope this will help you put your reader’s interest first. Looking forward to your feedback.
